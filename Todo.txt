Critical:

-clean up dependencies. in particular, utilities.h and utilities.hpp -> utilities.hpp needs to be something else

-separator
	-use nbhd instead of vertexcontainers

-file reader as template class
	-get rid of factory shit

-graph
	- deficiency set

-use set instead of map

-separator
	- ComputationBufferSet? wtf
	- Add "Eliminated" CCid & modify code accordingly


-Reset functions on any class that has containers which are re-used in new computations

-brush up const / inline

-use nullptr

Not so critical:
-pointers -> references

-PrintVertices function: name 1 2 3 4 etc.

-PrettyPrint -> use ostream&
		- default ostream& os = NULL; now we can handle both types of output

-RF chordalg_types -> headers

-clean up test fixtures

-file parsing
	-regex?
	-comment support
-use size_type

-vertex pair struct ( min, max )
