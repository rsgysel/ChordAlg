This file containts a short description of each heuristic and its usage.
Every heuristic first computes the atoms of the graph, and then triangulates each atom.

MMC_heuristic:
	"MMC_heuristic filename"
	Classic heuristic that minimizes monochromatic fill edges added at each elimination step.
	"MMC_heuristic filename --atoms"
	Runs MMC_heuristic on atom subgraphs.

PDRS_ratio_heuristic:
	"PDRS_ratio_heuristic filename"
	LB-elimination based heuristic that minimizes the following function:
		(#monochromatic fill edges) / (1 + #newly separated monochromatic pairs)
	at each elimination step.

PDRS_wsum_heuristic:
	"PDRS_wsum_heuristic filename sep_weight"
	LB-elimination based heuristic that minimizes the following function:
		(#monochromatic fill edges) + $sep_weight*(#newly separated monochromatic pairs)
	at each elimination step.
	Use sep_weight='inf' to ignore #monochromatic fill edges and base heuristic solely on separation.

Composite_heuristic:
	Uses MMC, PDRS_ratio, and PDRS_wsum heuristics. Usage is identical to PDRS_wsum_heuristic.

Mixed_heuristic:
	Chooses the vertex that minimizes # of monochromatic fill edges added in its neighborhood (i.e., it chooses the vertex classically), then triangulates by saturating each sub-star (i.e., it fills in the LB-triangulation way). Usage is identical to MMC_heuristic (including --atoms option).
